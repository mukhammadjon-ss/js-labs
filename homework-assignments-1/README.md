### ** TASK 1 **

#### Task: Implement Shape, Circle, and Rectangle Classes

Create an abstract class `Shape` that defines an abstract method `calculateArea()`. Then, implement two subclasses `Circle` and `Rectangle` that inherit from `Shape` and provide concrete implementations for the `calculateArea()` method.

---

#### Requirements:

1. **Abstract Class**:

    - Create an abstract class `Shape` with an abstract method `calculateArea()`.
    - The `Shape` class should not be instantiated directly.

2. **Inheritance**:
    - Create two subclasses, `Circle` and `Rectangle`, that inherit from `Shape`.
    - Each subclass must implement the `calculateArea()` method based on the type of shape.
        - `Circle` will calculate area using the formula `π * radius^2`.
        - `Rectangle` will calculate area using the formula `length * width`.

---

#### Class Breakdown:

-   **Abstract Class Shape**:
    -   Abstract method `calculateArea()`: This method should be implemented in the subclasses.
-   **Circle Class**:

    -   **Properties**: `radius` (number).
    -   Implements `calculateArea()`: Calculates the area using `π * radius^2`.

-   **Rectangle Class**:
    -   **Properties**: `length` (number), `width` (number).
    -   Implements `calculateArea()`: Calculates the area using `length * width`.

---

### ** TASK 2 **

#### Task: User Authentication System

Create a `User` class that encapsulates the private properties `username` and `password`. Implement a method `validateLogin()` to abstract the process of validating user credentials.

---

#### Requirements:

1. **Encapsulation**:

    - Keep the `username` and `password` properties private.
    - The password should not be accessible or modifiable directly from outside the class.

2. **Abstraction**:
    - Implement a method `validateLogin(inputPassword)` that abstracts the logic for checking if the provided password matches the user’s actual password.
    - The login validation process should be handled internally by the method without exposing the details of how passwords are compared.

---

#### Class Breakdown:

-   **Properties**:
    -   `username`: The username of the user (private).
    -   `password`: The password of the user (private).
-   **Methods**:
    -   `validateLogin(inputPassword)`: Checks if the provided `inputPassword` matches the stored password. Return `true` if valid, `false` otherwise.

### **TASK 3**

#### Task: Library and Book Classes

Create a `Library` class that maintains a collection of `Book` objects. Each `Book` object should have properties like `title`, `author`, and `isbn`. Implement methods to add and remove books from the library's collection.

---

#### Requirements:

1. **Class Structure**:

    - Create a `Book` class with the properties `title`, `author`, and `isbn`.
    - Create a `Library` class that contains an array of `Book` objects.

2. **Association**:
    - The `Library` class will be associated with multiple `Book` objects (one-to-many association).
    - A `Library` should be able to add and remove `Book` objects.

---

#### Class Breakdown:

-   **Book Class**:
    -   **Properties**:
        -   `title`: The title of the book.
        -   `author`: The author of the book.
        -   `isbn`: The ISBN of the book.
-   **Library Class**:
    -   **Properties**:
        -   `books`: An array that stores multiple `Book` objects.
    -   **Methods**:
        -   `addBook(book)`: Adds a `Book` object to the `books` array.
        -   `removeBook(isbn)`: Removes a book from the library by matching the `isbn`.

## ** TASK 4 (Optional) **

## Task Overview

You will build a simplified e-commerce system that includes several interconnected classes such as products, customers, orders, and payments. You will need to apply OOP principles to structure the relationships between these classes effectively.

### 1. **Product Class**

Create a `Product` class that encapsulates the details of a product.

-   **Properties**:
    -   `name`: Name of the product.
    -   `price`: Price of the product.
    -   `stock`: Number of items available.
-   **Methods**:
    -   `addStock(quantity)`: Adds a specific quantity to the stock.
    -   `reduceStock(quantity)`: Reduces a specific quantity from the stock, ensuring stock doesn’t go below zero.

### 2. **Customer Class**

Create a `Customer` class to represent a customer and their cart.

-   **Properties**:
    -   `name`: Customer’s name.
    -   `email`: Customer’s email.
    -   `cart`: Array of `Product` objects representing the customer’s cart.
    -   `address`: Customer's shipping address.
-   **Methods**:
    -   `addToCart(product)`: Adds a product to the cart.
    -   `removeFromCart(product)`: Removes a product from the cart.

### 3. **Order Abstract Class**

Define an abstract class `Order` to represent a general order.

-   **Properties**:
    -   `customer`: The customer who placed the order.
    -   `products`: Array of products in the order.
    -   `totalPrice`: The total cost of the order.

## Example Usage

Here is an example of how to use these classes:

```javascript
// Create a customer
const customer = new Customer(
    "John Doe",
    "john@example.com",
    "123 Main St"
);

// Create products
const phone = new Product("Smartphone", 699, 10);
const ebook = new Product("Ebook", 29, 100);

// Add products to the cart
customer.addToCart(phone);
customer.addToCart(ebook);

// Create an order
let order = new PhysicalOrder(customer, customer.cart);
order.calculateTotalPrice();

// Process payment
let payment = new CreditCardPayment(
    order.totalPrice,
    order,
    "1234-5678-9876-5432",
    "12/25"
);
payment.processPayment();

// Ship the order
let shippingService = new CourierShipping();
shippingService.shipOrder(order);
```
